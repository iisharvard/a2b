Aspect 1: Surgical Services Continuation

Counterparty (Tribal Leaders and Community)

	•	Positions (What): Demand that HfA continues its medical and surgical operations in Iguwafe, including addressing the growing measles outbreak. They also seek compensation for local guards and a commitment to reinforce local health services.
	•	Reasoning (How): The community relies on HfA’s medical services due to the lack of alternative healthcare providers. Sudden cessation will lead to dire health outcomes, including untreated trauma and measles. Compensation for guards acknowledges their sacrifices and sustains community trust.
	•	Motives and Values (Why): The community values health security and sees HfA as a critical part of their health infrastructure. Tribal leaders value justice for guards who suffered in the conflict and wish to maintain the community’s well-being and social stability.

User’s Organization (HfA)

	•	Motives and Values (Why): HfA’s core value is providing medical aid in conflict zones. Their motive to relocate resources to Ukraine stems from a commitment to respond to the most urgent global crises and pressure from major donors.
	•	Reasoning (How): With reduced conflict in Beta and the need for surgical expertise in Ukraine, it is strategic for HfA to reallocate its resources. Additionally, donor mandates and financial constraints make it difficult to sustain non-conflict related services in Iguwafe.
	•	Positions (What): HfA aims to exit Beta, shutting down operations at Iguwafe, while ensuring a smooth transition of health services to local authorities if possible.

Aspect 2: Staff Detainment and Safety

Counterparty (Tribal Leaders and Community)

	•	Positions (What): The tribesmen have placed HfA staff under house arrest, demanding that HfA recommit to the region before releasing the detained staff.
	•	Reasoning (How): Detaining the staff is a tactic to pressure HfA into reversing or delaying its exit from Beta and meeting the community’s demands for continued health services.
	•	Motives and Values (Why): The tribesmen seek to ensure healthcare provision for their community and compensation for their losses during the conflict. They see HfA’s departure as a betrayal and fear for the future of local healthcare.

User’s Organization (HfA)

	•	Motives and Values (Why): HfA prioritizes the safety and well-being of its staff and adheres to a strict no-ransom policy. The organization values humanitarian neutrality and is committed to maintaining its integrity in conflict situations.
	•	Reasoning (How): HfA seeks to negotiate the release of its staff without conceding to demands that would compromise its operational principles. Its no-ransom policy is designed to prevent exploitation and maintain global operational security.
	•	Positions (What): HfA insists on the safe release of its staff before making any decisions regarding continued operations in Iguwafe. They aim to resolve the crisis without compromising their broader mission or principles.

Aspect 3: Health Infrastructure Transition

Counterparty (Tribal Leaders and Community)

	•	Positions (What): Request HfA’s support in building the capacity of local health authorities and transitioning healthcare responsibilities to local actors, particularly concerning the measles outbreak.
	•	Reasoning (How): Given the lack of other healthcare providers, the community sees the continuation or proper transition of services as essential. Without HfA, there is no infrastructure or expertise to handle outbreaks or critical medical needs.
	•	Motives and Values (Why): The community and tribal leaders value health security and the survival of the local health system. They prioritize preventing disease outbreaks and ensuring the continuity of basic health services for their population.

User’s Organization (HfA)

	•	Motives and Values (Why): HfA values sustainable healthcare provision in conflict zones but also recognizes the importance of transitioning responsibility to local authorities where possible.
	•	Reasoning (How): HfA plans to negotiate a health service transition to local authorities or other NGOs, acknowledging the need for some healthcare continuation but constrained by funding priorities for Ukraine.
	•	Positions (What): HfA seeks to exit Beta while providing limited support for the transition of healthcare services to local actors, particularly for addressing urgent issues like the measles outbreak.
