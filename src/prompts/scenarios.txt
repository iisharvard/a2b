Given the redline and bottomline, show me the 5 scenarios where:

1. When the redline of the party 1 is violated
2. When the bottomline of the party 1 are crossed. Area of potential agreement favoring mostly the Party 2 but requiring the Party 1's negotiator to refer back to their hierarchy.
3. When none of the redlines or bottomlines are violated. Area of potential agreement favoring both sides within the limits of the respective bottom lines.
4. When the bottomlines of the party 2 are crossed. Area of potential agreement favoring mostly the Party 1 but requiring the Party 2's negotiator to refer back to their hierarchy.
5. When the redlines of the party 2 are violated. 

List these scenarios for each of the issues.
