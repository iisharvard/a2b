Red Lines (Non-Negotiable Limits)

A red line is an absolute constraint that a negotiator cannot violate under any circumstances. Crossing a red line results in the breakdown of negotiations or severe consequences for the organization.

Characteristics:
	•	Legally or institutionally binding: Defined by laws, policies, or official mandates.
	•	Non-negotiable: Fixed by the organization’s leadership and beyond the negotiator’s discretion.
	•	Strict enforcement: A breach could lead to:
	•	Nullification of the agreement
	•	Legal or financial liabilities
	•	Reputational damage
	•	Loss of legitimacy or authority in future negotiations
	•	Requires higher authority approval to revise: Cannot be altered during negotiation without explicit approval.

Examples:
	•	A humanitarian organization cannot accept armed escorts, even if it means losing access to a conflict zone.
	•	A multinational corporation cannot negotiate contracts with sanctioned entities, even if the deal is financially attractive.
	•	A government delegation cannot agree to terms that violate its constitution or international treaties.

Bottom Lines (Minimum Acceptable Terms)

A bottom line is the lowest acceptable outcome a negotiator can agree to while still achieving core objectives. It allows for strategic flexibility but ensures negotiations remain within an acceptable range.

Characteristics:
	•	Risk vs. benefit trade-off: Defined based on operational feasibility, financial constraints, and strategic priorities.
	•	Negotiable within limits: Can be adjusted through:
	•	Consultation with stakeholders or leadership
	•	Evolving negotiation dynamics
	•	New information or external pressures
	•	Tactical function:
	•	Helps assess walk-away points
	•	Maintains leverage and prevents disadvantageous agreements
	•	Ensures alignment with organizational priorities

Examples:
	•	A government negotiator aims for full fossil fuel phase-out but can accept a legally binding phase-out over a defined period.
	•	A development agency requires at least 30% of funds allocated for renewable energy projects to proceed with a funding agreement.
	•	A tech company negotiating a merger must retain majority control of its intellectual property but is willing to adjust revenue-sharing terms.
