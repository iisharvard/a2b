/**
 * Demo showing what a real LLM integration test would do
 * This is just a demonstration - it won't actually call the LLM without API keys
 */

console.log('=== LLM Integration Test Demo ===\n');

console.log('If you had API keys configured, this test would:');
console.log('1. Make a REAL call to OpenAI or Gemini (not mocked)');
console.log('2. Send a prompt that might generate responses with unescaped quotes');
console.log('3. Test that our JSON fixing logic handles real LLM responses');
console.log('4. Verify the entire flow works end-to-end\n');

console.log('Example test case:');
console.log('- Input: A negotiation case about "Food Without Borders" and "Local Militia"');
console.log('- Expected: LLM might return text like: The party said "we won\'t negotiate"');
console.log('- Our system should fix this to: The party said \\"we won\'t negotiate\\"\n');

console.log('To run real integration tests:');
console.log('1. Set environment variable: export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"');
console.log('2. Or: export GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY="your-api-key"');
console.log('3. Then run: npm test integration.test.ts\n');

console.log('The difference from unit tests:');
console.log('- Unit tests (promptHandler.test.ts): Use mocked LLM responses');
console.log('- Integration tests: Use REAL LLM API calls');
console.log('- Integration tests cost money (API usage) and take longer');
console.log('- Integration tests catch issues that mocks might miss\n');

const mockLLMResponse = {
  text: '{"result": "The organization "Red Cross" said: "We believe in humanitarian principles"}'
};

console.log('1. Raw LLM Response:', mockLLMResponse.text);
console.log('2. This would fail JSON.parse() due to unescaped quotes');
console.log('3. Our JSON fixer would detect and fix the quotes');
console.log('4. Final parsed result: { result: "The organization \\"Red Cross\\" said: \\"We believe in humanitarian principles\\"" }');
