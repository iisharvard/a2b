Given the above information, classify the issues into the following tiers:

Tier 1: Issues easily agreed to since they are at relatively
low cost and high benefit for both the human -
itarian organization and the counterparts, can serve
to build a relationship with the counterparts, and can
set a positive tone for the negotiation by addressing
some of the inner motives.

Tier 2: Issues on which an agreement comes at both
some cost and some benefits for the counterpar ts
and/or the humanitarian organization. The points of
agreement can be used to establish the basis of a
rational and fair distribution of cost/benefits.

Tier 3: Issues that are more complicated to address
and harder to solve because they come at a high cost
for the counterparts or the humanitarian organization.
These issues are often at the core of the conflict and
frequently are harder to negotiate because they are
close to or may fall below the respective red lines.
Such issues should be kept in mind but be put aside
at first so as to avoid confrontation on the positions that
might hijack the negotiation process and reinforce the
negative perception of the counterparts.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT add source references (like "Source 1", "Source 2", etc.) in your response. Simply state the issues and their categorization without referencing sources.
